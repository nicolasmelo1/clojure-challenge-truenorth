(defn- nicely-format-error-messages
  "This will format the error messages so it is flattened and will look identical to [\"Mallis\"](https://github.com/metosin/malli) library\n
   This is important because for the frontend it should not have any distinction. It would be bad to try to parse different formats of error messages.

   ### Example:
   ```clojure
    (nicely-format-error-messages 
      [{
        :reason {
          :filter-fields [Both query params should be defined] 
          :filter-values [Both query params should be defined]
        } 
       } {
        :reason {
          :sorting-fields [Query params should have the same length] 
          :sorting-orders [Query params should have the same length]
        }
      }] 
   
   ; will be formatted to:
   {
     :filter-fields [\"Both query params should be defined\"]
     :filter-values [\"Both query params should be defined\"]
     :sorting-fields [\"Query params should have the same length\"]
     :sorting-orders [\"Query params should have the same length\"]
   }
   ```
