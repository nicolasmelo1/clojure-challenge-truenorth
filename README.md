Hello, and welcome to the True North Clojure Challenge!

So you might be wondering. Hey, what is the documentation? I choose a monorepo for this challenge because it was a HELL lot easier to implement the solution.

`Client` is the frontend application
`Server` is the backend application

### How to run all applications at once

1. Start docker compose

```shell
$ docker compose up
```

2. Install the dependencies

```shell
$ pnpm i
```

3. Run the application

```shell
$ pnpm run dev
```
